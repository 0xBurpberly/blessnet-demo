        <p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>less is a decentralized edge compute network that delivers on-demand CPU and GPU resources close to end users, facilitating access to AI, machine learning, advanced data tools, and the evolving internet landscape.</p>
        
        <p>Developers can deploy applications with ultra-low latency and minimal cost, while anyone with spare computing resources can run a node, contributing to the network and earning rewards.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        
        <p class="quote">
            At Bless, we believe that access to compute is a basic human right.
        </p>
        
        <p><span class="small-caps">In the age of AI</span> and computer-based automation, the ability to harness and utilize compute is as fundamental as access to electricity or clean water. By democratizing computing, we aim to bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots. We envision a future where computing is accessible, equitable, and beneficial to everyone.</p>
        
        <p>By eliminating the need for centralized infrastructure, we reduce costs and complexities for developers while providing opportunities for individuals to turn their idle machines into active participants in the global compute grid. The cause is simple: democratize computing and ensure that the benefits of the web flow back to its users — not just corporations.</p>

        <h2>How Bless Works</h2>
        
        <h3>For Developers</h3>
        <p>Deploy your applications on our decentralized network with minimal configuration. Your workloads will automatically run on nodes geographically close to your end users, reducing latency and improving performance. Pay only for the resources you use, with no upfront commitments or hidden fees.</p>
        
        <h3>For Node Operators</h3>
        <p>Turn your idle computing resources into a source of income. By running a Bless node, you contribute to a more democratized internet while earning rewards proportional to the resources you provide. Setting up is simple, and your machine will automatically contribute when you're not using it.</p>
        
        <h3>The Network</h3>
        <p>The Bless network operates as a decentralized marketplace for computing resources. When a developer submits a workload, the network finds the optimal nodes to execute it based on geographic proximity, available resources, and cost. Node operators receive compensation for the resources they provide, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that benefits all participants.</p>
